# TravelPad

<p>The idea is to create an application that can help to manage trip. A lot of people organize their trips on their own, 
so they have a lot of information and documents. This kind of situation can cause some problems. A price is also very important thing during the trip. 
There are a lot of diffrent costs such as transportation, hotels and all the activities. 
Keeping all the prices in a one place and viewing the total price can help with financial aspect of a trip. </p>
<p>The TravelPad application is going to prevent from time wasting and uncomfortable feelings by storing all the most important information in a one place,
it will also keep track of all the trip costs.</p>

The initial trip structure will be divided into small parts in the application:

	- Transportation
	- Virtual traveling bag
	- Hotels and activities
